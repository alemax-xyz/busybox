## What is BusyBox?

[BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/) combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU [fileutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/fileutils/), [shellutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/shellutils/), etc. The utilities in [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/) generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/) provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.

_The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux_ - [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/) is a very good ingredient to craft space-efficient distributions.
